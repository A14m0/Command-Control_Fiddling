1. Fix problems related to uncleared server buffers
    * Check out loot downloading

2. Infinite looping happening when consecutive module executions

3. Add argparsing onto client 
    * Maybe homebrew in order to keep dependencies low?

4. Cleanup out/ after agent compilation

5. Allow for better catching of empty data file

6. Obfuscate client hard-coded values
    * Maybe a simple XOR encrypt-decrypt?
        ** Would be easy, but would include non-encrypted data

7. Add anti-debugging things
    * Test for sandboxing/VM (timed delay, VMWare asm instructions)
