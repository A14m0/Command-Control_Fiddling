1. Add manager handler for server
    
2. Infinite looping happening when consecutive module executions

3. Add agent beacon functionality

4. Add argparsing onto client 
    * Maybe homebrew in order to keep dependencies low?

5. Cleanup out/ after agent compilation

6. Allow for better catching of empty data file

7. Fix NULL character buffer problems in server

8. Obfuscate client hard-coded values
    * Maybe a simple XOR encrypt-decrypt?
        ** Would be easy, but would include non-encrypted data

9. Add anti-debugging things
    * Test for sandboxing/VM (timed delay, VMWare asm instructions)
