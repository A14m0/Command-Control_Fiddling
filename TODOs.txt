1. Fix problems related to uncleared server buffers
    * Check out loot downloading

2. Infinite looping happening when consecutive module executions

3. Add argparsing onto client 
    * Maybe homebrew in order to keep dependencies low?

4. Cleanup out/ after agent compilation

5. Allow for better catching of empty data file

6. Obfuscate client hard-coded values
    * Maybe a simple XOR encrypt-decrypt?
        ** Would be easy, but would include non-encrypted data

7. Add anti-debugging things
    * Test for sandboxing/VM (timed delay, VMWare asm instructions)
        ** Resources for this:

Server gets a connection from client to start shell listener. 
The server then enters the specific handler and chooses a random high port and adds a structure to 
a global data list. The manager can then querry the available ports to connect to and connects to 
the one that has been selected. the server just forwards the plaintext information between the two 
different connections. Could maybe specify a shell in the reverse-shell request options so you could 
load a meterpreter over ssh? Check if it is possible to spawn a terminal app with a specific file 
descriptors
