1. Finish auto-client compilation option on server

2. Add argparsing onto client 
    * Maybe homebrew in order to keep dependencies low?

3. Create interface to store client authentication with server 
    * No idea how its gonna go, but hey whatever

4. Obfuscate client hard-coded values
    * Maybe a simple XOR encrypt-decrypt?
        ** Would be easy, but would include non-encrypted data
