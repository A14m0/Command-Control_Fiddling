1. Add manager handler for server
    * Catch connection type (either agent or manager)

2. Add agent beacon functionality

3. Add argparsing onto client 
    * Maybe homebrew in order to keep dependencies low?

4. Cleanup out/ after agent compilation

5. Allow for better catching of empty data file

6. Fix NULL character buffer problems in server

7. Obfuscate client hard-coded values
    * Maybe a simple XOR encrypt-decrypt?
        ** Would be easy, but would include non-encrypted data

8. Add anti-debugging things
    * Test for sandboxing/VM (timed delay, VMWare asm instructions)
