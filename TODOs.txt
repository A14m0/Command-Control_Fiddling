1. Finish auto-client compilation option on server

2. Add argparsing onto client 
    * Maybe homebrew in order to keep dependencies low?

3. Create interface to store client authentication with server 
    * No idea how its gonna go, but hey whatever

4. Obfuscate client hard-coded values
    * Maybe a simple XOR encrypt-decrypt?
        ** Would be easy, but would include non-encrypted data

5. Add anti-debugging things
    * Test for sandboxing/VM (timed delay, VMWare asm instructions)

    * Redo call from manager to SSH_REQ_SHELL

8. Push connection to thread earlier than it is already

9. Allow adding of agent information to the database through commandline tags

10. Allow for better catching of empty data file
