# Command-Control_Fiddling
A C2 server/client/management project written in C, C++, and Python 3.

We are working on making the server more modular in order to include varied agent functions, 
transports, and agent implementations.

As it stands right now, the only transport is over an SSH connection.

## Documentation Status

As it stands right now, the code in the `testing` branch is so volatile any documentation 
written about it would become quickly outdated. Therefore, we are copping out and not
writing any docs until the code has stabilized :)
