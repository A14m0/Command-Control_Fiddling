Things to do:
    1) Ensure that available MAX_SESSION indexes gets reused on the end of execution
    2) Ensure that you cannot have more than MAX_SESSION sessions


Agent/Server/Manager interactions:
    1) Agents open up a tunnel on a time loop (which can be randomized)
    2) Server adds address to a file (maybe something like "agents.txt")
        Format: 
            IP:Hostname:privs:loot?(t/f):session_index
        Server also adds IP to a history file (maybe "agent_history.txt")
    3) When a manager software connection requests an updated list of agents, 
       the server reads in "agents.txt" and sends that data to the manager software
       which reads the data and parses it into a GUI listing format
    4) The manager software can then send a command for any one individual agent,
       which will be dispatched by the control server
